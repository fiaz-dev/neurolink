# NeuroLink

NeuroLink is a Python package that aims to provide various AI capabilities, including a chatbot, image processing, audio processing, Django support, and more. It utilizes TensorFlow and other related technologies for natural language processing and AI tasks.

## Description

The NeuroLink package is designed to offer developers an easy and efficient way to incorporate AI functionalities into their projects. It provides a chatbot module that can understand and respond to user input using TensorFlow for intent classification. Additionally, it includes modules for image processing, audio processing, and Django integration, making it a versatile AI package for different applications.

**NOTE: This package is currently under development and not yet ready for production use. Use it at your own risk.**

## Planned Features

- **Text Processing:** Offers functionalities for text manipulation, analysis, and processing. It includes features like text cleaning, tokenization, stemming, and named entity recognition.
- **Chatbot:** Provides a conversational interface for interacting with users. The Chatbot utilizes TensorFlow for natural language processing and intent classification. It will allow users to have interactive conversations and receive responses based on the input.
- **Image Processing:** Offers functionalities for image manipulation, analysis, and recognition. It includes features like image filtering, object detection, and image-based AI tasks.
- **Audio Processing:** Allows processing and analysis of audio files, including speech recognition and synthesis. It provides features like speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and audio-based AI tasks.
- **Django & Flask Support:** Provides integration with Django, a popular Python web framework. This enables seamless integration of AI functionalities into web applications built with Django.
- **And more:** Planned features include additional AI capabilities and modules for natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, and other AI-related tasks.

## Installation

**NOTE: This package is still in development and not yet Stable. Use it at your own risk.**

this package is released, it can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install neurolink
```
To update neurolink to the latest version, add --upgrade flag to the above commands.

## Try your first NeuroLink program
    
    import neurolink
    
    """
    Sample Test Case to get a response from the chatbot
    """

    intents_path = "intents.json"
    model_path = "model.tflearn"
    data_path = "data.pickle"
    initialize_obj = neurolink.initialize(intents_path, model_path, data_path, train_model=True)
    response = initialize_obj.chat("Hi", 0.5)
    print(response)

**Above model is for reference, its uses intents.json for dataset and sample format that is used to create simple chatbot [check out here](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/neurolink/blob/master/intents.json)**

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The project is currently in active development, and some features may not work properly on older versions. It is recommended to upgrade to the latest version for optimal performance and compatibility.
